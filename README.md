# BorderRadius59

https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/25591

This repo shows border radius rendering in react-native 0.59.10. Border radii of less than or equal to the border width render correctly.

See https://github.com/mjmasn/BorderRadius60 for the incorrect rendering in react-native 0.60.0
